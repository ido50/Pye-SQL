=head1 NAME

Pye::SQL - Log with Pye into MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Pye::SQL;

	my $pye = Pye::SQL->new(
		db_type => 'mysql', # or 'pgsql' or 'sqlite'
		database => 'my_log_database',
		table => 'myapp_logs'
	);

	# now start logging
	$pye->log($session_id, "Some log message", { data => 'example data' });

	# inspect the logs from the command line
	pye -b SQL -t mysql -d my_log_database -T myapp_logs

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package provides a relational SQL backend for the L<Pye> logging system.
It currently supports MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite.

All of these database systems will require prior creation of the target database
and table.

=head2 MySQL

When creating a table for logs, use something like this:

	CREATE TABLE logs (
		session_id VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL,
		date DATETIME(6) NOT NULL,
		text TEXT NOT NULL,
		data TEXT
	);

	CREATE INDEX logs_per_session ON logs (session_id);

For the C<session_id> and C<text> columns, note that the data type definition is
purely a suggestions. Use your own judgment as to which data types to use, and
what lengths, according to your application.

=head2 PostgreSQL

It is recommended to use PostgreSQL version 9.3 and up, supporting JSON or JSONB
columns. When creating a table for logs, use something like this:

	CREATE TABLE logs (
		session_id VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL,
		date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
		text TEXT NOT NULL,
		data JSON
	);

	CREATE INDEX ON logs (session_id);

If using v9.4 or up, C<data> might better be a C<JSONB> column. As with C<MySQL>,
use your own judgment for the data type and length of C<session_id> and C<text>,
according to your application.

If you're planning on running your own queries on the C<data> column, you will need to
create an index on it. Read PostgreSQL's online documentation on JSON data types for
more information.

=head2 SQLite

When using SQLite as a backend, create the following table structure:

	CREATE TABLE logs (
		session_id TEXT NOT NULL,
		date TEXT NOT NULL,
		text TEXT NOT NULL,
		data TEXT
	);

	CREATE INDEX logs_per_session ON logs (session_id);

Note that, as opposed to other database systems, SQLite will take the path to the
database file as the C<database> parameter, instead of a database name. You can also
provide C<:memory:> for an in-memory database.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new( %options )

Create a new instance of this class. The following options are supported:

=over

=item * db_type - the type of database (C<mysql>, C<pgsql> or C<sqlite>), required

=item * database - the name of the database to connect to, defaults to "logs" (if using SQLite,
this will be the path to the database file)

=item * table - the name of the table to log into, defaults to "logs"

=back

The following options are supported by MySQL and PostgreSQL:

=over

=item * hostname - the host of the database server, defaults to C<127.0.0.1>

=item * port - the port of the database server, defaults to C<3306> for MySQL, C<5432> for PostgreSQL

=back

=cut

sub new {
	my ($class, %opts) = @_;

	croak "You must provide the database type (db_type), one of 'mysql' or 'pgsql'"
		unless $opts{db_type} &&
			_in($opts{db_type}, qw/mysql pgsql sqlite/);

	$opts{db_type} = lc($opts{db_type});

	return bless {
		dbh => DBI->connect(
			_build_dsn(\%opts),
			$opts{username},
			$opts{password},
			{
				AutoCommit => 1,
				RaiseError => 1
			}
		),
		json => JSON->new->allow_blessed->convert_blessed,
		db_type => $opts{db_type},
		table => $opts{table} || 'logs'
	}, $class;
}

=head1 OBJECT METHODS

The following methods implement the L<Pye> role, so you should refer to C<Pye>
for their documentation. Some methods, however, have some MongoDB-specific notes,
so keep reading.

=head2 log( $session_id, $text, [ \%data ] )

If C<\%data> is provided, it will be encoded to JSON before storing in the database.

=cut

sub log {
	my ($self, $sid, $text, $data) = @_;

	$self->{dbh}->do(
		"INSERT INTO $self->{table} VALUES (?, ".$NOW{$self->{db_type}}.', ?, ?)',
		undef, "$sid", $text, $data ? $self->{json}->encode($data) : undef
	);
}

=head2 session_log( $session_id )

=cut

sub session_log {
	my ($self, $session_id) = @_;

	my $sth = $self->{dbh}->prepare("SELECT date, text, data FROM $self->{table} WHERE session_id = ? ORDER BY date ASC");
	$sth->execute("$session_id");

	my @msgs;
	while (my $row = $sth->fetchrow_hashref) {
		my ($d, $t) = $self->_format_datetime($row->{date});
		$row->{date} = $d;
		$row->{time} = $t;
		$row->{data} = $self->{json}->decode($row->{data})
			if $row->{data};
		push(@msgs, $row);
	}

	$sth->finish;

	return @msgs;
}

=head2 list_sessions( [ \%opts ] )

Takes all options defined by L<Pye>. The C<sort> option, however, takes a standard
C<ORDER BY> clause definition, e.g. C<id ASC>. This will default to C<date DESC>.

=cut

sub list_sessions {
	my ($self, $opts) = @_;

	$opts			||= {};
	$opts->{skip}	||= 0;
	$opts->{limit}	||= 10;
	$opts->{sort}	||= 'date DESC';

	my $sth = $self->{dbh}->prepare("SELECT session_id AS id, MIN(date) AS date FROM $self->{table} GROUP BY id ORDER BY $opts->{sort} LIMIT $opts->{limit} OFFSET $opts->{skip}");
	$sth->execute;

	my @sessions;
	while (my $row = $sth->fetchrow_hashref) {
		my ($d, $t) = $self->_format_datetime($row->{date});
		$row->{date} = $d;
		$row->{time} = $t;
		push(@sessions, $row);
	}

	$sth->finish;

	return @sessions;
}

sub _format_datetime {
	my ($self, $date) = @_;

	my ($d, $t) = split(/T|\s/, $date);
	$t = substr($t, 0, 12);

	return ($d, $t);
}

sub _remove_session_logs {
	my ($self, $session_id) = @_;

	$self->{dbh}->do("DELETE FROM $self->{table} WHERE session_id = ?", undef, "$session_id");
}

sub _build_dsn {
	my $opts = shift;

	if ($opts->{db_type} eq 'mysql') {
		'DBI:mysql:database='.
			($opts->{database} || 'logs').
				';host='.($opts->{hostname} || '127.0.0.1').
					';port='.($opts->{port} || 3306).
						';mysql_enable_utf8=1';
	} elsif ($opts->{db_type} eq 'pgsql') {
		'dbi:Pg:dbname='.
			($opts->{database} || 'logs').
				';host='.($opts->{hostname} || '127.0.0.1').
					';port='.($opts->{port} || 5432);
	} else {
		# sqlite
		'dbi:SQLite:dbname='.($opts->{database} || 'logs.db');
	}
}

sub _in {
	my $val = shift;

	foreach (@_) {
		return 1 if $val eq $_;
	}

	return;
}
